🧑‍💼 Employee Management System — A Simple Java Project to Make Things Easier
Hey there! This is a beginner-friendly Employee Management System built using Java, JDBC, and MySQL. It's a small and straightforward project designed to help manage employee records smoothly — nothing too fancy, just practical and useful.

💡 What This Project Does
This system allows you to:

✅ Add new employees

🔍 View all employee records

✏️ Update employee details

❌ Delete employee data (with safe confirmation)

🕒 Optionally manage attendance too (with proper foreign key support)

The focus is on learning how real-world CRUD operations work with database integration.

🔧 Tech Used
Java

JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)

MySQL

Console-based User Interface

🙌 Why I Built This
This project is part of my backend development learning journey. I wanted to understand how Java interacts with databases through JDBC, and how to build a basic system that’s both educational and functional.

It’s not perfect, but it’s built with genuine effort and a lot of learning. If you’re just starting out with Java and databases, I hope this helps or inspires you in some way.
